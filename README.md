# Project Summary: Prime Number Calculation Application

## Overview
The Prime Number Calculation Application is a .NET 8.0-based console application designed to perform operations related to prime numbers. This project is part of the "Accelerate App Development Using GitHub Copilot" learning path and demonstrates the capabilities of GitHub Copilot in assisting with software development.

## Project Structure
The project is organized within a Visual Studio solution ([`copilot.sln`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcopilot%2Fcopilot.sln%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/copilot/copilot.sln")) and includes the following key components:

- **Solution File**: [`copilot.sln`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcopilot%2Fcopilot.sln%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/copilot/copilot.sln")
- **Project Directory**: Prime
  - **Source Code**: Program.cs
  - **Project File**: Prime.csproj
  - **Build Artifacts**: Located in `bin/` and `obj/` directories

## Key Features
1. **Prime Number Summation**: The application includes a function to sum all prime numbers in a given list of integers.
2. **Prime Number Validation**: A utility function to check if a given number is prime.
3. **Random Number Generation**: The application can generate a list of random numbers for testing purposes.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub Copilot

### Example Code
#### Summing Prime Numbers
```csharp
int addPrimeNumbersInNumericList(List<int> numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int number in numbers)
    {
        if (isPrime(number))
        {
            sum += number;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Prime Number Check
```csharp
bool isPrime(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1)
    {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.Sqrt(number); i++)
    {
        if (number % i == 0)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate the use of GitHub Copilot to accelerate development.
- Showcase practical applications of prime number calculations.
- Provide hands-on experience with .NET 8.0 and C#.

## Conclusion
The Prime Number Calculation Application is a robust example of leveraging modern development tools and practices to create efficient and functional software. It serves as an educational resource for developers looking to enhance their skills with GitHub Copilot and .NET technologies.
